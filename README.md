# Smart Ride Allocation System

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement

In high-demand urban areas, traditional ride-hailing platforms struggle with latency, poor ETA predictions, and inefficient driver-user matching â€” especially with electric vehicles (EVs) and variable traffic.

**This project aims to build an AI-augmented, scalable backend system that can allocate rides efficiently in real-time.**

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Spring Boot / FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis
- **ML/AI:** Python + scikit-learn + PyTorch (for ETA prediction)
- **Messaging Queue:** Apache Kafka
- **Architecture:** Microservices
- **Deployment:** Docker + Kubernetes + AWS/GCP
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana

## ðŸŽ¯ High-Level System Goals

- Handle 10K+ concurrent ride requests
- Predict ETA accurately using live traffic + historical data
- Match drivers based on location, battery, traffic, and more
- Dynamic pricing based on demand/supply zones
- Scalable, fault-tolerant, low-latency backend system
